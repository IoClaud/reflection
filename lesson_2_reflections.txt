Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Git create a new directory in qhich where it will keep track of all the versions that I save, which means that you can start tracking files and changes to those files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is an intermediate area where I can add changes before
    committing them to the repository.  This allows me to add changes to the
    staging area one-by-one, then commit them all at once, which makes it easier
    to specify what changes should go into each commit.
